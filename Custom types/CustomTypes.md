# How to register a custom type for YNFO
---

To register a custom type for YNFO you need to create a python file, make sure that the name of the file follows this structure:
`<your custom type name>_type.py`

Once you created the file you can use the template in `custom_type.py`.

Next you would need to specify a RegEx for your type so that the parser knows how to treat it, then modify the name of your type and run the script.

Congrats! You've just added your custom type for YNFO!
